## 📌 Introduction

**gcoder** is an AI-powered code assistant built as a Visual Studio Code extension. It uses custom logic and open-source AI models to help you write better code, faster. We were inspired by other great assistants in the marketplace, but we wanted to create something **lightweight**, **transparent**, and **community-driven**.

Whether you're learning to code or deploying to production, gcoder aims to be your helpful sidekick.
